# BigQuery and Cloud

### By Philip Kendall

#### This project utilizes BigQuery, BigQuery Python client library, and SQL to create and manipulate data in various ways.
## Technologies Used

* GIT
* BigQuery CLI
* BigQuery Python client library
* Google SQL
* Jupyter Notebooks


## Description

The BigQuery CLI is used to crate a dataset called 'plants'. A BigQuery client is then created using Python which is then utilized to list, and make sure it has been created. SQL is then used in BigQuery, which has been stored in the main.sql file, to create and seed values into a new table called 'flower_shop'. The Python client is used again to list that new table.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Fork over the the repository to your own Github account.
* Clone your Github repo down to your local machine and into the directory you would like this project to be stored.
* Navigate to the main.ipynb and main.sql file and open it in your text editor.
* Install the requirements.txt file
* After that, the project should be able to run.
